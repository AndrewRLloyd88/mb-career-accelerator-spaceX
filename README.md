## About this project

[SpaceXploration](https://spacexploration-mb.netlify.app/) is an app that uses the SpaceX API to track SpaceX launches and rockets. Often times, information about SpaceX can be packed with data and extremely dense. We wanted to make sure our application presented SpaceX information in a way that was digestible and intuitive while presenting the latest in SpaceX launches.

SpaceXploration was developed with React, Typescript, and Snowpack. Check out the hosted application [here on Netlify](https://spacexploration-mb.netlify.app/). This project was developed as a part of the Mintbean.io [Developers' Collective](https://devcollective.io/).

## Introduction

SpaceX has an [open source API project](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API) on Github. Not only does the API have excellent routes, but the entire backend is fully open source, which means it can serve as an excellent reference point.

The SpaceX API is very featureful and has many endpoints - from fairings to crew to launchpads, so there are many things that you can build on top of it. This project involved finding capabilities inside the SpaceX API that interested our team, then implementing a project of our own design around those endpoints.

Our team explored the SpaceX API documentation available on the SpaceX repo. Then experimented with the live API using Postman to gain an understanding of its capabilities.

## SpaceX Tracker

âœ¨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

### Available Scripts

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm run build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**For the best production performance:** Add a build bundler plugin like "@snowpack/plugin-webpack" to your `snowpack.config.js` config file.

### npm test

Launches the application test runner.
Run with the `--watch` flag (`npm test -- --watch`) to run in interactive watch mode.
