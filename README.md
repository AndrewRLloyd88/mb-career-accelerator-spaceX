# SpaceX Tracker

## About this project

This project is a part of the Mintbean Full Stack Accelerator program.

## Introduction

SpaceX has an [open source API project](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API) that you can inspect on Github. Not only does the API have excellent routes, but the entire backend is fully open source, which means it can serve as an excellent reference point for your needs.

This project involves finding capabilities inside the SpaceX API that interests you, then implementing a project of your own design around that endpoint.

This is an open-ended project with a time limit. Please continue adding new functionality as you go. Once the time limit elapses, a new project will be provided.

## Requirements

Since this is an open open-ended project, no specific user stories have been provided. Instead, this project involves the following steps:

1. API exploration
2. Feature design
3. Implementation

## Step 1: API Exploration

Sooner or later, exploring an API becomes a part of every software developer's repertoire. Go through the documentation available on the SpaceX repo. Then, experiment with the live API using Postman to gain an understanding of its capabilities.

## Step 2: Feature Design

Come up with initial user stories and requirements for your application. This should be done by finding consensus with your group. The SpaceX API is very featureful and has many endpoints, so there are many things that you can build on top of it.

One approach to going about doing this is to find a few capabilities that look interesting and see what you can build on top of them. Another approach to this is to come up with features based on your overall understanding, then seeing which endpoints could be used to implement the feature. Your pod leader (Monarch Wadia) may offer your group some further requirements as you go, based on your progress.

You should scope your project to be completeable in 4 weeks time.

## Step 3: Implementation

Once you have the basic application designed, you can begin implementing it in code. You may use any software you like for this phase. Please ensure that your code is in a public repo and is deployed to a public URL on the web.

# SpaceX Tracker

> âœ¨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

## Available Scripts

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm run build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**For the best production performance:** Add a build bundler plugin like "@snowpack/plugin-webpack" to your `snowpack.config.js` config file.

### npm test

Launches the application test runner.
Run with the `--watch` flag (`npm test -- --watch`) to run in interactive watch mode.
